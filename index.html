                    <p>
                        <span>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</span><br>
                        It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                        China.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                        breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                        respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                        mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
                        with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                                            People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are
                                            living
                                            in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the
                                            disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or

                                            Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a

                                            Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to
                                            blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and
                                            myths.

                                            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and

                                            such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                            coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                                            between
                                            people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.

                                            This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first
                                            infections
                                            were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from
                                            person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on

                                            less so.

                                            It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.
                                            Some
                                            other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months
                                            but
                                            that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other
                                            months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease
                                            when
                                            weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility,
                                            severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are
                                            ongoing.

                                            Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                            respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                                            COVID-19
                                            associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                                            your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout
                                            the
                                            day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                                            bathroom.

                                            It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                            that
                                            has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                                            but
                                            this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                            In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there

                                            likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over

                                            The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
                                            frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and
                                            maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or
                                            sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more

                                        The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some
                                        patients
                                        may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.
                                        These
                                        symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
                                        develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                                        disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
                                        COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                                        those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                                        diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and
                                        difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                            dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school
                                            dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare

                                            It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.
                                            Some
                                            other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months
                                            but
                                            that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other
                                            months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease
                                            when
                                            weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility,
                                            severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are

                                            Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                            respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                                            COVID-19
                                            associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                                            your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout
                                            the
                                            day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                                            bathroom.

                                            It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                            that
                                            has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                                            but
                                            this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                            In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                                            is
                                            likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over

                                            could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which

                                            sneezes,
                                            or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean
                                            your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
                                            water.
                                            Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

                                            Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e.
